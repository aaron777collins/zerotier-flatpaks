# Zerotier Flatpaks
Creates flatpaks from the AUR repos for [Zerotier-one](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/zerotier-one/) and [Zerotier-Gui](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/zerotier-gui-git)
> Abandoned in favor of my new [ZeroTier-GUI-Arch](https://github.com/aaron777collins/ZeroTier-GUI-Arch) project which packages everything into a simple installer and gui.

## DISCLAIMER
I am not the owner of either of these repos. I am simply packaging them into flatpaks for personal use with my steam deck.
